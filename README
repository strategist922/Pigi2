The project Pigi2 is spun off from pigi-project.org, a beautiful but a little bit obsolete (references an older version of HBase).

The goal is to enable indexing, pagination and maintaing sort order in HBase records. Until we provide decent documentation here,
please look up pigi-project.org for further info.

You are also invited to cooperate in this project; it is work in progress. 

It works though, we use it in our company... well, is there any other option? Seems like there's none in the whole world; am I wrong?
