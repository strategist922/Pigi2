The project Pigi2 is spun off from pigi-project.org, a beautiful but a little bit obsolete (references an older version of HBase).

The goal was to enable indexing, pagination and maintaing sort order in HBase records. Until we provide decent documentation here,
please look up pigi-project.org for further info.

You are also invited to cooperate in this project; it is work in progress. 

Since I do not work at Choochee anymore, I have not plans so far for working on this project. It's up for grabs;
if you are interested, just let me know.
